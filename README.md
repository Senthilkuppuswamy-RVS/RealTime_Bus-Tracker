# RealTime_Bus-Tracker

This Project uses MBTA data to determine the stops between Harvard and MIT. Mapbox Account was created and the access token is used to the mapboxgl instance. The marker is created and added to the map using mapboxgl. The function move is used to move the marker from MIT to Harvard. The animated marker highlights the bus routes on the map.
